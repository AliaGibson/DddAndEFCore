Welcome to DDD and EF Core
=====================

This is the source code for my Pluralsight course DDD and EF Core (the link is coming soon)

How to Get Started
--------------

Create a database using the Database-initial.sql script, modify the connection string in appsettings.json, and you are good to go!

Source code for each module
---------------------------

Source code for each module is tagged and available on the Releases tab. For example, tag "module-3-working-with-many-to-one-relationships" indicates the state of the sample project at the start of module 3, which is named "Working with Many-to-one Relationships"
